# offene-register-text-analyzis

Some random collection of files regarding the text analysis of German corporates' names and associated officers.

## Caveats

The count of names in the data is skewed. It's impossible to create uniquie fingerprints for each person (since there is, i.e., no date of birth). So each registration is counted as one occurence. If one person is registered with two companies, it counts as two occurences. There are some people that have a lot of registrations. So I won't trust the data blindly. It can still show some patterns.
